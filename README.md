# Big-Data-Project
It is a project that is coded by me and my teammate in the extent of Big Data (CENG 476) course.

Spotify is a music streaming and podcast service that provides a monthly 
subscription through a digital music platform that allows unlimited listening 
of selected singers, albums, songs from different kinds of genres. Since, music 
and artists are very important parts of advertisements on TV, we aim to help 
advertisement industry by analyzing Spotify data to understand which 
genre is listened the most and which artist has the most followers. Thus, 
Marketing companies can advertise the product to wider range of 
audience. 

To achieve this goal, we used Spotify data, which is collected from 1921 up 
to 2020 collected by Yamac Eren Ay. The data can be found on 
kaggle.com. We used Google Colab environment and PySpark for this 
purpose.
